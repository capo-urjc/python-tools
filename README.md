# Welcome to capo-tools documentation

[![ci](https://github.com/capo-urjc/python-tools/actions/workflows/python-publish.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/capo-urjc/python-tools/actions/workflows/python-publish.yml/badge.svg)

Here will be the documentation for the capo-tools package. 
This is a work in progress and, though the functions included may be working and useful, 
the library itself is highly experimental and may change in the future so not recommended for production use.
Use at your own risk.

To test the library you can install it from test pypi using the following command:

```
pip install -i https://test.pypi.org/simple/ --extra-index-url https://pypi.org/simple --upgrade capo_tools
```
